# Annah's CPSC 210 Project

## Project Introduction

*What will the application do?*

The current plan for this project is to create a task manager that can also double as a calendar schedule. A user will be 
able to enter in different classes and other commitments like jobs or volunteering. Within each of these commitments a user
will be able to enter in individual tasks or deliverables and the due dates attached to them. Users then can view the tasks 
in an organized list under individualized commitment tabs, all together in one list, or in calendar form with the attached 
dates that were entered. 
 
*Who will use it?*

This application is directed at students and people in task-based careers, although it can also be used in general for daily life. 

*Why is this project of interest to you?*

As an engineering student, I have to deal with lots of busy days, and I need to be able to manage my time well and keep 
track of all my assignment due dates and exam dates. I have tried a variety of scheduling software programs and calendar 
apps; however, none of them have the exact specifications I am looking for. Thus, I concluded that I should build my own 
because I would understand my needs the best.
